# AggRent

An innovative tool that facilitates renting, buying and selling of used and new agriculture machinery. It solves the problem of farmers with old and outdated equipment not being able to acquire modern machinery. It also solves the problem of farmers having machinery sitting around during off season. Our website also has a blog that connects farmers. The technologies we used for this project were JavaScript for both the front end and back end and React for the front end. We also utilized an AI software called RoboFlow to predict farm machinery prices. 

Keeping the theme in mind, we brainstormed possible problems and their solutions. We noticed that our problem needed more viable solutions. This inspired us to work on our problem.
# The Problem we Solved
Many farmers use old and outdated machinery and may not have the funds to afford efficient modern technology. This can slow down their production pace and result in the falling behind to modern technology. On the flip side, there exist farmers who own modern technology but aren't using it during the off season.
Our website solves both these problems by allowing farmers to rent their equipment out to others in need. The inbuilt blog furthers social interaction, benefiting users through potential knowledge gain and alerts.
